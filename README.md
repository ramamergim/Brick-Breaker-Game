# Brick-Breaker-Game
Brick Breaker Game is developed in Java and is a simple game. I used it for a project during my studies in 2016

If you want to run it, simply import this repository to your ide, then open BreakoutGame.java and run it.

If you run it, you can see that there are a number of Bricks (Row x Column). If you want to change that number,
just open the interface Sizes.java and change the BRICK_ROWS and BRICK_COLUMNS values.

If you have any question related to this game, feel free to email me.
